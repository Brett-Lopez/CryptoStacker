Login using the “Login” button in the top right
- Select the “Scheduler” button in the top right
- Select the “DCA calculator” button
- Provide info for your schedule:
  - Box 1: The amount to purchase per DCA event.  We recommend $10 to enable high frequency dollar-cost averaging.  Please note, you must purchase at least $10 per DCA due to exchange purchase minimums.
  - Box 2: The number of days over which you wish to spread your DCA events. A common parameter is the number of days between paychecks.  If there are 15 days between paychecks you would set this number to 15.
  - Box 3: The total dollar amount you wish to purchase during a DCA period. For example, if you wish to allocate $300 per paycheck you would set this to 300.
