# The benefits of high frequency dollar-cost averaging

Many of us buy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum using the traditional dollar-cost averaging strategy: every payday we buy some cryptocurrency.  Although this strategy is wise and very fruitful for those who stick to it, there is another dollar-cost averaging strategy that takes better advantage of Bitcoin’s volatility: high frequency dollar-cost averaging.

In order to illustrate the difference between a traditional dollar-cost averaging strategy and a high frequency dollar-cost averaging strategy let's use the following numbers:
- You wish to purchase $600 of Bitcoin per month
- You are paid twice a month, on the 1st & 15th
- Assume each month is 30 days

Using traditional dollar-cost averaging strategy, you purchase $300 on the 1st and $300 on the 15th, or $600 once per month.

With a high frequency dollar-cost averaging strategy, you purchase $10 worth of Bitcoin 60 times over the course of the month with each of the 60 purchases spread evenly among the time period, in this case 30 days, regardless of the price.  This means purchasing $10 every 720 minutes (12 hours).  

Why are we using $10 in this example?  Because the goal of a high frequency dollar-cost averaging strategy is to break up a month’s worth of dollar-cost averaging into the smallest purchase amount possible and spread out those purchases evenly throughout the month and $10 is the minimum amount you can purchase on Coinbase or Coinbase Pro (Coinbase Pro has lower fees than Coinbase and it’s free to all Coinbase users).

What is the benefit of this strategy?

The price of Bitcoin is volatile, so buying often means you have many more opportunities to buy the dip and even if the price dips lower the next day you’re buying the dip again.  This reduces your cost basis (cost per coin) so you end up with more Bitcoin for the same US dollars.

If you backtest this strategy against Bitcoin price data, you’ll find that even a small increase in the amount of Bitcoin purchased with a high frequency dollar-cost averaging strategy results in significantly larger returns.

In the screenshots above we can see that a total investment of $37,800 was made using both strategies but there are key differences in the results:
- The high frequency dollar-cost averaging strategy resulted in 7.173404 Bitcoin or $319,749.63 worth at a price of $44,574.32
- The traditional dollar-cost averaging strategy resulted in 7.004769 Bitcoin or $259,886.39 worth at a price of $44,574.32
- The high frequency strategy saw a ROI of 745.90% vs 587.53% for the traditional strategy
- The high frequency strategy has a 23% larger US dollar value with only 2.4% more Bitcoin

This is why we created CryptoStacker!  CryptoStacker gives you the ability to create flexible high frequency dollar-cost averaging schedules which automates the high frequency DCA strategy but it also allows you to create these schedules with high availability so even if your favorite exchange is down during a big dip your schedule will run on a different exchange of your choice during the outage.
